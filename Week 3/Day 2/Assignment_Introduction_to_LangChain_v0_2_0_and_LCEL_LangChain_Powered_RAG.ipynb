Here is the full keynote presentation by\\nSteve Jobs‚Ä¶.\\n TRANSCRIPT: \\nSteve Jobs- Apple CEO\\nThis is the day I‚Äôve been looking forward to for two and a half years.\\nEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything and\\nApple has been ‚Äì well, first of all, one‚Äôs very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these\\nin your career. Apple has been very fortunate. It‚Äôs been able to introduce a few of these into\\nthe world.\\n1984 ‚Äì we introduced the Macintosh. It didn‚Äôt just change Apple. It changed the whole\\ncomputer industry.\\nIn 2001, we introduced the first iPod. And it didn‚Äôt just change the way we all listen to\\nmusic, it changed the entire music industry.\\nWell, today we‚Äôre introducing three revolutionary products of this class. The first one is a\\nwidescreen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone.\\nAnd the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device.\\nSo, three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls; a revolutionary mobile phone; and a\\nbreakthrough Internet communications device. An iPod, a phone, and an Internet\\ncommunicator. An iPod, a phone‚Ä¶ are you getting it? These are not three separate devices,\\nthis is one device, and we are calling it iPhone. Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone,\\nand here it is.\\nNo, actually here it is, but we‚Äôre going to leave it there for now.\\nSo, before we get into it, let me talk about a category of things. The most advanced phones\\nare called smart phones, so they say. And they typically combine a phone plus some e-mail\\ncapability, plus they say it‚Äôs the Internet. It‚Äôs sort of the baby Internet into one device, and\\nthey all have these little plastic keyboards on them. And the problem is that they‚Äôre not so\\nsmart and they‚Äôre not so easy to use, and so if you kind of make a Business School 101\\ngraph of the smart axis and the easy-to-use axis, phones, regular cell phones are right there,\\nthey‚Äôre not so smart, and they‚Äôre not so easy to use.\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

They‚Äôre\\nreally complicated. Just for the basic stuff people have a hard time figuring out how to use\\nthem. Well, we don‚Äôt want to do either one of these things. What we want to do is make a\\nleapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been and super-easy\\nto use. This is what iPhone is.\\nSo, we‚Äôre going to reinvent the phone. Now, we‚Äôre going to start with a revolutionary user\\ninterface. It is the result of years of research and development, and of course, it‚Äôs an\\ninterplay of hardware and software.\\nNow, why do we need a revolutionary user interface. Here‚Äôs four smartphones, right?\\nMotorola Q, the BlackBerry, Palm Treo, Nokia E62 ‚Äî the usual suspects. And, what‚Äôs wrong\\nwith their user interfaces? Well, the problem with them is really sort of in the bottom 40\\nthere. It‚Äôs this stuff right there. They all have these keyboards that are there whether or not\\nyou need them to be there. And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic\\nand are the same for every application. Well, every application wants a slightly different\\nuser interface, a slightly optimized set of buttons, just for it.\\nAnd what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now? You can‚Äôt run around\\nand add a button to these things. They‚Äôre already shipped. So what do you do? It doesn‚Äôt\\nwork because the buttons and the controls can‚Äôt change. They can‚Äôt change for each\\napplication, and they can‚Äôt change down the road if you think of another great idea you want\\nto add to this product.\\nWell, how do you solve this? Hmm. It turns out, we have solved it. We solved in computers\\n20 years ago. We solved it with a bit-mapped screen that could display anything we want.\\nPut any user interface up. And a pointing device. We solved it with the mouse. We solved\\nthis problem. So how are we going to take this to a mobile device? What we‚Äôre going to do is\\nget rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen. A giant screen.\\nNow, how are we going to communicate this? We don‚Äôt want to carry around a mouse,\\nright? So what are we going to do? Oh, a stylus, right? We‚Äôre going to use a stylus. No. Who\\nwants a stylus? You have to get them and put them away, and you lose them. Yuck. Nobody\\nwants a stylus. So let‚Äôs not use a stylus.\\nWe‚Äôre going to use the best pointing device in the world. We‚Äôre going to use a pointing\\ndevice that we‚Äôre all born with ‚Äî born with ten of them. We‚Äôre going to use our fingers.\\nWe‚Äôre going to touch this with our fingers. And we have invented a new technology called\\nmulti-touch, which is phenomenal. It works like magic. You don‚Äôt need a stylus. It‚Äôs far\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

It ignores unintended\\ntouches, it‚Äôs super-smart. You can do multi-finger gestures on it. And boy, have we patented\\nit.\\nSo we have been very lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to the\\nmarket in our time. First was the mouse. The second was the click wheel. And now, we‚Äôre\\ngoing to bring multi-touch to the market. And each of these revolutionary interfaces has\\nmade possible a revolutionary product ‚Äî the Mac, the iPod and now the iPhone. So, a\\nrevolutionary user interface. We‚Äôre going to build on top of that with software.\\nNow, software on mobile phones is like baby software. It‚Äôs not so powerful, and today we‚Äôre\\ngoing to show you a software breakthrough. Software that‚Äôs at least five years ahead of\\nwhat‚Äôs on any other phone. Now how do we do this? Well, we start with a strong foundation.\\niPhone runs OSX.\\nNow, why would we want to run such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile\\ndevice? Well, because it‚Äôs got everything we need. It‚Äôs got multi-tasking. It‚Äôs got the best\\nnetworking. It already knows how to power manage. We‚Äôve been doing this on mobile\\ncomputers for years. It‚Äôs got awesome security. And the right apps. It‚Äôs got everything from\\nCocoa and the graphics and it‚Äôs got core animation built in and it‚Äôs got the audio and video\\nthat OSX is famous for. It‚Äôs got all the stuff we want. And it‚Äôs built right in to iPhone. And\\nthat has let us create desktop class applications and networking. Not the crippled stuff that\\nyou find on most phones. This is real, desktop-class applications.\\nNow, you know, one of the pioneers of our industry, Alan Kay, has had a lot of great quotes\\nthroughout the years, and I ran across one of them recently that explains how we look at\\nthis, explains why we go about doing things the way we do, because we love software.\\nAnd here‚Äôs the quote: ‚ÄúPeople who are really serious about software should make their own\\nhardware.‚Äù Alan said that 30 years ago, and this is how we feel about it. And so we‚Äôre\\nbringing breakthrough software to a mobile device for the first time. It‚Äôs five years ahead of\\nanything on any other phone.\\nSynch with iTunes\\nThe second thing we‚Äôre doing is we‚Äôre learning from the iPod, synching with iTunes. You\\nknow, we‚Äôre going to ship our 100 millionth iPod this year, and that‚Äôs tens of millions of\\npeople that know how to synch these devices with their PCs or Mac and synch all of their\\nmedia right on to their iPod. Right? So you just drop your iPod in, and it automatically\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

Your Contacts, your Calendars and your Photos, which you can get on your\\niPod today, your Notes, your Bookmarks from your Web browser, your e-mail accounts, your\\nwhole e-mail set-up.

We‚Äôve got a headset jack. 3.5 millimeter all your iPod headphones fit right in.

We‚Äôve got three really advanced sensors\\nbuilt into this phone. The first one is a proximity sensor. It senses when physical objects\\nget close, so when you bring iPhone up to your ear, to take a phone call, it turns off the\\ndisplay, and it turns off the touch sensor, instantly.

Widescreen video like you‚Äôve never seen on a portable device, 160 pixels per\\ninch, gorgeous screen quality, gorgeous album art, and cover flow. It‚Äôs the best iPod we‚Äôve\\never made.\\nAgain, some screen shots. It‚Äôs unbelievable. Here‚Äôs some album art I just put up, so you can\\nsee what it looks like. Just, no matter what you like, it looks pretty doggone gorgeous. And\\nof course, cover flow and video, with on-screen controls.\\nYou know, I was showing this to somebody ‚Äî I was giving a demo to somebody a while ago,\\nwho had never seen this before, inside Apple. And I finished the demo, and I said what do\\nyou think. They told me this, they said, You had me at scrolling. So, the iPhone with the\\nmost amazing iPod ever. You can now touch your music. So that‚Äôs the iPod.\\nNow, let‚Äôs take a look at a revolutionary phone. We want to reinvent the phone. Now, what‚Äôs\\nthe killer app? The killer app is making calls! It‚Äôs amazing ‚Äî it‚Äôs amazing how hard it is to\\nmake calls on most phones. Most people actually dial them every time. Most people don‚Äôt\\nhave very many numbers in their address book they use their recents as their address book.\\nRight? How many of you do that? I bet more than a few. So, we want to let you use contacts\\nlike never before. You can synch your iPhone with your PC or Mac and bring down all your\\ncontacts right into your phone. So you‚Äôve got everybody‚Äôs numbers with you at all times.\\nWe have something that‚Äôs going to revolutionize voice mail. We call it visual voice mail.\\nWouldn‚Äôt it be great if you had six voice mails if you didn‚Äôt have to listen to five of them first\\nbefore you wanted to listen to the sixth? Wouldn‚Äôt that be great if you had random access\\nvoice mail? Well, we‚Äôve got it. Just like e-mail you can go directly to the voice mails that\\ninterest you. Excellent audio quality. iPhone is a quad-band, GSM plus EDGE phone. We\\nhave decided to go with the most popular international standard, which is GSM. We‚Äôre on\\nthat bandwagon, headed on that roadmap, and plan to make 3G phones and all sorts of\\namazing things in the future. So, quad-band GSM plus EDGE, and of course we have wi-fi\\nand Bluetooth 2.0 EDR built in, as well.\\nSo this is what it looks like when you get a call. This is what it sounds like. It‚Äôs one of our\\nring tones, you can pick of course.\\nSo, I want to show you four things. I want to show you the phone app, photos, a calendar,\\nand SMS messaging. The kind of things you would find on a typical phone, but in a very\\nuntypical way. So let‚Äôs go ahead and take a look.\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

I\\njust push it right here, and boom, I‚Äôm in the phone. And I‚Äôve got five buttons across the\\nbottom: favorites, recents, contacts, keypad and voice mail. I‚Äôm in contacts, right now,\\nagain. How do I move around my contacts? I just scroll through them. And so, let‚Äôs say I\\nwant to make a call to Jony Ive. I can just push here, and I see Jony Ive‚Äôs context, with all his\\ninformation: his three phone numbers, his e-mail, whatever else, his address, whatever else\\nI‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs all in one place. And if I want to call Jony, all I do is push his phone number. I‚Äôll\\ncall his mobile number right now. And now, we are calling Jony here.\\nHey, Jony, how you doing? Well, it‚Äôs been 2.5 years, and I can‚Äôt tell you how thrilled I am to\\nmake the first public phone call with iPhone. I remember when we first started working on\\nthis, and it‚Äôs just unbelievable. Woah, what is this? I‚Äôve got another call coming in. Jony, can\\nI put you on hold for a minute?

Jony, you there? Phil, you there? So\\nhere we are, and listen I got to get back to my keynote, so if I want to do that, I just touch\\nthis arrow right here, and I‚Äôm going to go ahead and take Jony private here and put Phil on\\nhold. Jony, do you have anything to say on the first phone call?\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m[\u001b[0m\u001b[32m‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too shabby is it?‚Äù Ive says\u001b[0m\u001b[32m]\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nIt‚Äôs not too shabby. You take care, Jony. And I end this call. Phil‚Äôs on hold. I take him off of\\nhold. Phil, thanks very much, I‚Äôve got to get back to the keynote now. Alrighty.\\nSo, now I‚Äôve also got a way to make a list of favorites here, from my most-often called\\nnumbers so I can just touch it once and dial the number. And I might want to add somebody\\nto favorites, so let‚Äôs say I want to add Phil Schiller, I just push that plus button in the upper\\nright-hand corner right there, and up pop my favorites, and I can just go to S is here and\\nthere‚Äôs Phil, so Phil Schiller is right there.

Boom, there we go. It‚Äôs that simple to edit these\\nthings. Very, very easy. I‚Äôve got recents right here, which is all my recent phone calls. If I\\nwant to see the ones I‚Äôve missed, which are in red, I can just go up and touch that button at\\nthe top, and boom, those are all the ones I‚Äôve missed, and those are all the calls that I‚Äôve\\nplaced or have gotten. If I want to dial the phone, if I‚Äôm real last-century, I can push keypad\\nhere, and I can dial a call just with ‚Ä¶ oops, called four, sorry. Wrong number. 408-996-1010.\\nAnd it formats the numbers and if I want to, I can just keep dialing, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a European\\nnumber, and the numbers just keep getting smaller, real simple. Very simple to dial with the\\nkeypad.\\nNow let me show you visual voice mail. This is so cool. This is a collaboration that we‚Äôve\\ndone, which I‚Äôll talk more about later, and it allows us to have random access voice mail. Go\\ndirectly to the voice mails we want. So as an example, I come to my voice mail, and I say, oh,\\nthere‚Äôs one by Al Gore. I want to hear that one. I just push it.\\nNow, if I want to call Al back right now, I can just push that call back button. But I want to\\nlisten to one from Tim Cook that I‚Äôve got here, so let me listen to Tim.\\nIsn‚Äôt this awesome. And so I‚Äôve got voice mail how I want to listen to it, when I want to listen\\nto it, in any order I want to listen to it with visual voice mail. So that is a quick tour of the\\nphone app.\\nNow what I want to do is show you SMS texting. So I just go to that SMS icon in the upper-\\nleft-hand corner and push it. And I not only have SMS texting, but I have multiple sessions.\\nSo I can be carrying on conversations with people, and every time I get messages from\\nthem, I can be alerted to that, and go check it out. As an example here, I‚Äôve got Eddie Q and\\nI‚Äôve been carrying on a conversation with Eddie, and I just tap this, and here‚Äôs the\\nconversation I‚Äôve been carrying on right here. And if there‚Äôs a new message it will tell me.\\nAnd so there‚Äôs a new message from Phil, and let‚Äôs see the conversation was what.\\nAnd I‚Äôve got this little keyboard which was phenomenal. It does error prevention and\\ncorrection. Not that I won‚Äôt make some, I probably will. But it‚Äôs actually really fast to type\\non. It‚Äôs faster than all these little plastic keyboards on all these smart phones. So I can just\\nsay sounds great, see you there. And I can send that. And there it is. It‚Äôs that simple. And\\nwhen Phil messages me back, I‚Äôll be alerted, I‚Äôll see the dot, and I can just go pick up that\\nconversation where it left off. If I want to send a message to Eddie or Scott, I just push this\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

So that‚Äôs SMS messaging, and again, you‚Äôve seen\\nthe keyboard, it‚Äôs pretty awesome. We‚Äôll come back to that a little bit later.\\nAnd the third app I want to show you as part of the phone package is Photos. You know, we\\nhave a two-megapixel camera built in, as I said. We also have the coolest photo management\\napp ever, certainly on a mobile device, but I think maybe ever. And so here‚Äôs our photos. I‚Äôm\\ngoing to go into our photo library, and this is our library and again, I can just scroll through\\nphotos here with my finger. Pretty cool. Let me go to photo album, I‚Äôll pick Italy, and I just,\\nlet‚Äôs start at the top. And to go through pictures, I just swipe them. I can just swipe through\\nmy photo library. There‚Äôs one that‚Äôs landscape. I can just turn my device and take a look at\\nit. Pretty cool, huh?\\nSo I can even swipe when I‚Äôm in landscape here. Isn‚Äôt this awesome? The other thing I can\\ndo is I can take any of these pictures and I can make them bigger. So let me go ahead and\\nget the camera back up. I can take my fingers and I can, we call it the pinch, I can bring\\nthem closer together and move them further apart to make it bigger or smaller. So I can just\\nmove them further apart and stretch the image. Isn‚Äôt that cool? I can move it around,\\nand‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt that cool? And now what I can do is I can pick to make this my wallpaper. And of\\ncourse, I could jigger it around then and just set the wallpaper, and now if I‚Äôm back at home\\nand I go to sleep, when I wake up from here on out, until I reset it, that‚Äôs my wallpaper.\\nWhenever I‚Äôm making a call, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to see. Boom. There we go. So photos,\\nSMS and the phone app. That is part of our phone package for iPhone.\\nGet a call, again, just really great call management features, just scroll through contacts\\nwith your finger. All the information at your fingertips here. Favorites, last century, visual\\nvoice mail. Calendar, SMS texting, incredible photo app, the ability to just take any picture\\nand make it your wallpaper. It‚Äôs pretty unbelievable, and I think when you have a chance to\\nget your hand on it, you‚Äôll agree, we have reinvented the phone.\\nSo, now, let‚Äôs take a look at an Internet communications device as part of iPhone. So what‚Äôs\\nthis all about? Well, we‚Äôve got some real breakthroughs here. To start off with, we‚Äôve got\\nrich, HTML e-mail on iPhone. The first time really rich e-mail on a mobile device. And it\\nworks with any IMAP or POP e-mail service. You got your favorite mail service, it‚Äôll likely\\nwork with it. And it‚Äôs rich text e-mail. We wanted the best web browser in the world on our\\nphone, not a baby web browser or a WAP browser, a real Web browser, and we picked the\\nbest one in the world, Safari, and we have Safari running on iPhone. It is the first fully\\nusable HTML browser on a phone.\\nThird, we have Google Maps. Maps, satellite images, directions and traffic. This is\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

We have widgets, starting off with weather and stocks.\\nAnd this communicates with the Internet over EDGE and Wi-fi. And iPhone automatically\\ndetects Wi-fi and switches seamlessly to it. You don‚Äôt have to manage the network. It just\\ndoes the right thing.\\nNow, I want to take a second and talk about e-mail. We hook up to almost any IMAP or\\nPOP3 mail service. I just want to give you some examples. IMAP of course is the best\\nbecause you can keep folders and all your e-mail on the server and access it from anywhere.\\nYahoo Mail is IMAP. Microsoft Exchange has an IMAP option. And obviously. Mac mail is\\nIMAP, as well. POP3, Google Gmail, AOL Mail, and most ISPs are POP3 e-mail.\\nNow, I want to take a minute and highlight one. Yahoo! Mail. Yahoo! Mail is the biggest mail\\nservice in the world. They have over a quarter billion users. Biggest e-mail service in the\\nworld, and today, we are announcing with Yahoo! that they are going to provide free push\\nIMAP e-mail to all iPhone customers. So, this isn‚Äôt just IMAP e-mail. It is push IMAP e-mail.\\nSo when you get a message, it will push it right out to the phone for you. Same as a\\nBlackBerry. Free IMAP push e-mail from Yahoo!. So we think this is a pretty big deal. So\\nwhat I‚Äôd like to do now is I‚Äôd like to show you mail, Safari, Google Maps and widgets\\nrunning on iPhone. So let‚Äôs go see.\\nSo let‚Äôs go into mail. Second icon from the left on the bottom there. I just touch it with my\\nfinger, and boom, I‚Äôm there. And so I‚Äôve got an in-box here, and this is, by the way, running\\nlive on Yahoo! IMAP e-mail. This stuff is coming off a Yahoo! server somewhere up in the\\ncloud. And so I can say James Vincent here sent me an e-mail. He‚Äôs a proud father, and\\nthere we go. And I can just scroll here. I‚Äôve got in-line photos, rich text e-mail. There we go.\\nSo let‚Äôs look at another one. Phil Schiller. She loved the gift. Again, in-line photos, rich text,\\npretty nice. Shopping list, again, rich text right here. Pretty cool. Directions to Sushi Ron for\\ntonight‚Äôs dinner. Now, iPhone of course parses out phone numbers and you can see there‚Äôs a\\nphone number in blue. I can just touch it, and boom, I‚Äôm going to call this place. I don‚Äôt\\nreally want to call them so I‚Äôm going to end the call here. But you get the idea.\\nAnd this last one, Ken Bereskin is one of our marketing folks. He just returned from\\nAntarctica. Ken‚Äôs a great photographer, and he took all these great photos of penguins in\\nAntarctica. Look at this, it‚Äôs great. Right in your e-mail, right on your phone. And if I want to\\nby the way, I can look at my e-mail with a split view just like I do on my computer, and so I\\ncan select something here and just look at it down here if I want to push my messages real\\nfast and just find that one message I was looking for. But I actually like the full-screen view.\\nAnd of course, we have a standard in-box and drafts, and all sorts of folders you can put\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

And again, free IMAP e-mail from Yahoo!.\\nNow, let me go ahead and create an e-mail message. Show you what that‚Äôs like. So again,\\nwhen I don‚Äôt need a keyboard it‚Äôs not there. When I do, it‚Äôs there. I want to send a message\\nto, let‚Äôs say, Phil. I just type Ph, and boom, Phil Schiller, it‚Äôs address completion and maybe\\nI‚Äôll send one to Scott Forrestal, as well, and there‚Äôs Scott right there, and let‚Äôs say the\\nsubject is dinner. Boom, and I just hit send. It sends that e-mail, and we‚Äôre done. So that is\\nmail. Full desktop class e-mail running on a mobile device.\\nAll right, now I want to show you something incredible. I want to show you Safari running\\non a mobile device. So let‚Äôs go to the Web, and here we are. I‚Äôm going to load in, rather than\\napple.com here, a more universal site. I‚Äôm going to load in the New York Times, it‚Äôs kind of\\na slow site because it‚Äôs got a lot of images, but here we‚Äôre loading and we‚Äôre loading over\\nwi-fi right now. And rather than just give you a WAP version of the New York Times, rather\\nthan giving you this wrapped version all around, we‚Äôre showing you the whole New York\\nTimes Web site, and there it is. Guess what I can do, I can just put this into landscape mode,\\nand there it is right there. And I can scroll here if I want. Scroll up and down here. Still\\nloading it in. There we go. Or I can just get back like this.\\nNow, this is really great and I can see the whole page but of course I can‚Äôt read it. It‚Äôs a\\nlittle too small. So I can get in with my fingers and pinch it but we have an optimization\\nhere. I can just double-tap on anything and it automatically fills up the screen with it. And I\\ncan just scroll around like this and scroll over here and I can even make this text bigger if I\\nwant to, and there it is. Just double-tap again to get back to the whole page. Isn‚Äôt this cool?\\nLook at this. There is the New York Times. And again, any article I want, boom, there we go.\\nBoom. Unbelievable.\\nNow, you can look at multiple Web pages as well. You can have multiple Web pages open.\\nSo I just push this button in the lower-right hand corner. Shrinks it down, and I can add a\\nnew page if I want. And I‚Äôll go to Amazon here out of my bookmarks. So let‚Äôs go to Amazon.\\nAnd I love to go the DVD section of Amazon and see what DVDs are selling. I like it\\nespecially when Disney‚Äôs are in the top. And, so here‚Äôs Amazon, and even before the whole\\npage is loaded on, I‚Äôm just going to double-tap on this, and I‚Äôm going to say let‚Äôs go to the\\nDVD section here, and now it‚Äôs doing that. And here we are.\\nAnd there‚Äôs a section over here in the right hand side right there, and these are the top\\nsellers, updated hourly. Oh look, Al‚Äôs Inconvenient Truth is number one. Alright.

Zoom up to that\\npicture so we can all see it. And again, isn‚Äôt this cool? Just go over there and get back to this\\none. I can get rid of it just by hitting the X. And there we go. Isn‚Äôt that incredible? Safari.\\nYou know, if you‚Äôve ever used what‚Äôs called a Web browser on a mobile phone, you‚Äôll know\\nhow incredible this is. I hope you‚Äôll never really know, because it‚Äôs bad out there today, and\\nthis is a revolution of the first order, to really bring the real Internet to your phone.\\nLet me show you something about widgets here. Let‚Äôs go to stocks right now, and we‚Äôre\\ngoing to load stock information off the Web, and just right onto the phone here. Oh, look,\\nApple‚Äôs up! That‚Äôs great! Well, I could look at different graphs here if I want to. And that‚Äôs\\nfantastic. Let‚Äôs look at the percentages here. Oh, good. Good good. So I‚Äôve got stocks right\\nhere, and I can go look at the weather. Let‚Äôs see what it‚Äôs like outside. 49 degrees, but it‚Äôs\\nsupposed to get to 61 today, so that‚Äôs good. We‚Äôll just stay in here until it warms up. Now,\\nI‚Äôve got Paris right here. I can have as many of these as I want, so it‚Äôs nighttime in Paris. It‚Äôs\\nactually warmer in Paris at night than it is here today. Wow. Aspen, well, no snow until later\\nin the week. And Hawaii. Oh, it‚Äôs raining, that‚Äôs not good. Well, anyway, here‚Äôs four places.\\nHawaii, Aspen, Paris and San Francisco, and again, the weather widget.\\nNow, to conclude with the Internet device section here, I want to show you something truly\\nremarkable, which is, Google Maps on iPhone. I hit our maps application here and it‚Äôs\\ncoming up. And it shows us North America, and I‚Äôm going to go to Moscone West. That‚Äôs\\nwhere we are right now. And here we are. Boom. That‚Äôs where we are.\\nNow, what I‚Äôm going to do, is I‚Äôm going to go look for something. I‚Äôm going to certainly want\\na cup of coffee afterwards, so I‚Äôm just going to look for Starbucks, right? Starbucks, so I‚Äôm\\ngoing to search for Starbucks, and sure enough, there‚Äôs all the Starbucks. Now, I can get a\\nlist of Starbucks here, and I can pick that one if I want, and I can even go look at that\\nStarbucks, and there it is, and let‚Äôs give them a call.\\n‚ÄúGood morning, Starbucks, how can I help you?‚Äù\\nYes, I‚Äôd like to order 4,000 lattes to go, please. No, just kidding, wrong number. Thank you.\\nBye-bye.\\nNow, I can zoom in by just pinching if I want to. Or I can just double click to zoom in, and I\\nget just higher and higher resolution versions of the map. So let‚Äôs go somewhere else here\\nthat I‚Äôve got bookmarked. Let‚Äôs go to the Washington Monument. And so here‚Äôs Washington,\\nD.C, and I could just double-tap and I‚Äôm going in a little further here, just double-tapping in.\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

Steve says that each company should do the absolutely\\nbest thing that they can do every time, and I think he has shown it once again today.\\nInternet architectures allow you now to take the enormous brain thrust that is represented\\nby the Apple development team and combine that with the open protocols and data services,\\nthe companies like Google and the others represented that are coming up in a bit, to\\nactually put them together in a seamless environment for end users.\\nWhat I particularly like about this is ‚Äì it‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs all come together in one place.\\nAnd from a Google perspective, what we have done is we‚Äôve pushed very, very hard to\\npartner with others and particularly partner with Apple, the companies, the cultures are\\nsimilar, innovation, having fun while you are doing it, and also working with many, many\\ndifferent data services. So Steve showed a little bit of some of the components, some of the\\npieces and so forth that you can do but understand that this is a set of data just for maps\\nand partners and so forth, so that you really can get the full integration. The person doesn‚Äôt\\nunderstand how hard it was to get it all together, it comes together seamlessly.\\nFrom my perspective, this is the first of whole new generation of data services where these\\npowerful based cloud computers, Google being ‚Äì we hope ‚Äì a leading representative\\nprovides HTML, XTML and other sophisticated services, that the Safari browser that‚Äôs\\nembedded into iPhone and many other of its type devices, future devices out of Apple will be\\nable to take advantage.\\nSteve, my congratulations to you and this product is going to be hot.\\nSteve Jobs- Apple CEO\\nThank you, Eric. As a board member, you will get one of the first ones.\\nOkay. Now, you also can‚Äôt think about the Internet without thinking about Yahoo!. And again\\non the phone, we‚Äôve got Yahoo! Search built right in, you can select which one you want to\\nuse. Just type in something, hit that Yahoo! button and boom, you‚Äôre off. And of course, we\\nalso have Yahoo! IMAP e-mail services.

IMAP email, the\\nfirst one we are doing, but also hopefully on a whole variety of other popular services from\\nYahoo!\\nOne of the things that we are going to be doing with Apple is also launching some of our\\nnew services that we announced this week Yahoo! Go, Yahoo! One Search and hopefully we\\ncan get Yahoo! One Search which is one of our new products on to this phone which is really\\ninnovative way of looking at search. You‚Äôre really able to not get the traditional web search\\nresults but rather get all the things you want in a very concise format aggregated, if having\\nthings like San Francisco you‚Äôll get all the local news, local weather and local maps all in\\none place. So we‚Äôre looking forward to doing that.\\nAs Steve said, mail was a killer app on the phone and Yahoo! is really trying to redesign and\\nre-innovate and reinvent the web experience and internet experience on the mobile devices.\\nSo on the email you can look forward not only to great web services like the best spam\\nprotection, address books integration and the calendar if you‚Äôre on Yahoo!. Just think it‚Äôs\\nbasically like having a BlackBerry without the Exchange server. This is really going to be\\nreally great not only having a seamless experience from your PC, take into your mobile\\ninternet. Yeah, there‚Äôs some clapping out there, I can hear that.\\nLastly, we want to be able to really take what Apple is doing on the phone by reinventing\\nthe phone and reinventing the device. We want to be able to do that on the Internet and\\nwhat we‚Äôre doing is really being able to take great form factors, great user experiences and\\ngreat UI that we‚Äôre taking from not only the web but also in the back end services and\\ntranslate them into a seamless web experience. So we‚Äôre big believers in great hardware\\nand great software and we‚Äôre big believers in taking the web services and Web 2.0 model\\nand take them to the device world.\\nSo Steve, my address you have it all. Please send it to me. Thanks again.\\nSteve Jobs- Apple CEO\\nYou know, it‚Äôs been great having the two greatest companies on the Web right down the\\nblock. Google and Yahoo!

I want to listen to some music, so I\\nwant to go into my iPod here and let‚Äôs see, in artists, I want to listen to, oh, maybe Red Hot\\nChili Peppers, I love those guys. And so I‚Äôm listening to a song of theirs. And let‚Äôs see what\\nhappens when I get a phone call. Music fades out. Screen changes. Got a phone call coming\\nin. So I can ignore it, but I think I‚Äôm going to answer it. So I‚Äôll answer it. Howdy. Hi Phil,\\nlisten I‚Äôm kind of busy right now. What can I do for you?\\nOh, Okay, hold on just a sec. So I push the home button on my wallpaper and I go home\\nright here, and I‚Äôm still on the call. You can see the phone thing flashing right there on the\\nlower left. And I go into photos and now I‚Äôm in photos and you can see the bar across the\\ntop, the green bar, I can just touch that to return to the call. And Phil wants a photo that he\\nwanted to use it for his screensaver, it was one of the ones that was taken in Hawaii, I think\\nit was this one. Yep, there it is.\\nSo you want me to mail this to you, Phil? So I again I just go down here and push this\\nbutton, and rather than use it as wallpaper, I‚Äôm going to e-mail it. So watch what happens\\nnow. It shrinks it a little bit, and then a compose windows will come up right behind it.\\nThere we go. And I will just tap in the to field and send this to Phil here, Phil Schiller there\\nwe go. And the e-mail is there, yep, it‚Äôs there, and I‚Äôm just going to send it. Hey, Phil, that\\nshould be on its way right now.\\nAnything else?‚Ä¶Let me go check it out. I think I‚Äôve got Fandango in my bookmarks here.\\nYes, I do. Let‚Äôs go to Fandango, figure out what movies are playing. ‚Ä¶ To go back to my call\\nI just touch the top here, and I‚Äôm back at my call, and I‚Äôm just going to go ahead and end the\\ncall. What happens now? Back in my music. So, this is what it‚Äôs like when you put it all\\ntogether.\\niPhone. Today Apple is reinventing the phone.\\nNow how does this stack up. Let‚Äôs go back to these guys. Let‚Äôs take a look. Well, these are\\ntheir home screens. And again, as you recall, this is iPhone. This is what their contacts look\\nlike. This is what iPhone‚Äôs contacts look like, and again, you just pick one and you see\\neverything about that person, all the information you have. This is what mail looks like on\\nthese smartphones. Again this is what mail looks like on iPhone. You have rich, HTML, rich\\ntext e-mail. This is what calendars look like on these guys. This is what calendars look like\\non iPhone. This is what the Web looks like, and we tried to make it look as good as we could\\non these. It usually looks worse and this is what you get, and of course, this is what you get\\non iPhone, and you can zoom in and see anything you want. And this is what you get for\\nmusic players, nobody really uses them much, and this is what you get on iPhone.\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

Got some great stereo\\nheadphones we‚Äôre going to be shipping, and they‚Äôve got a little addition to them, which is\\nthis little thing right over here. It‚Äôs a microphone and a switch, so you can talk, you have\\nthem in there, you can get a call and just talk. Beautiful reception on the microphone. And\\njust push it together to answer a call or hang up on a call. So you can be wearing them. It\\njust dangles right there and picks up your voice beautifully.\\nAnd we also have a Bluetooth accessory headset that we‚Äôre going to be shipping and there it\\nis right there. It‚Äôs incredibly small and just to let you see what it looks like, it‚Äôs got one\\nbutton on the top for answering and hanging up a phone call. You never have to turn it off or\\non. It just goes to sleep. It automatically pairs with iPhone so you don‚Äôt have to worry about\\npairing. It‚Äôs really simple. And it‚Äôs very tiny. This is what it looks like in-ear. It‚Äôs just\\nbeautiful. It‚Äôs the coolest one that we‚Äôve ever seen. So Bluetooth headset coming as well.\\nBattery life. A lot of these smartphones have pretty low battery lives. We‚Äôve managed to get\\nfive hours of battery, and that‚Äôs for talk time, video or browsing. Five hours of battery life,\\nand 16 hours of audio playback, so that‚Äôs dramatically better than any of these smartphones.\\nThere is a tremendous amount of high technology in iPhone. We‚Äôve been pushing the state\\nof the art in every facet of this design. So let me just talk a little bit about it here. We‚Äôve got\\nthe multi-touch screen. A first. Miniaturization, more than any we‚Äôve done before. A lot of\\ncustom silicon. Tremendous power management. OSX inside a mobile device. Featherweight\\nprecision enclosures. Three advanced sensors. Desktop class applications, and of course, the\\nwidescreen video iPod. We‚Äôve been innovating like crazy for the last few years on this, and\\nwe filed for over 200 patents for all the inventions in iPhone, and we intend to protect them.\\nSo, a lot of high technology. I think we‚Äôre advancing the state of the art in every aspect of\\nthis design. So iPhone is like having your life in your pocket. It‚Äôs the ultimate digital device.\\nSo what should we price it at? Well, what do these things normally cost? An iPod, the most\\npopular iPod, $199 for 4 gig nano. What‚Äôs a smartphone cost? Well, they say you get the\\nphone and some of the Internet with it, although that‚Äôs questionable. But they cost\\nsomewhere around $299. You can get them for $199. Palm just introduced one at $399\\nyesterday, so they generally average about $299 with a two-year contract.\\nNow, these phones sort of do music but nobody uses them for music because they‚Äôre not\\nvery good and so they end up buying an iPod to go with the phone. We know, we sell the\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

What should we charge for iPhone.\\nBecause iPhone has got a lot more than this stuff. It‚Äôs got video. Real video. It‚Äôs got this\\nbeautiful gorgeous wide screen. It‚Äôs got multi-touch user interface. It‚Äôs got wi-fi. It‚Äôs got a\\nreal browser. It‚Äôs got HTML e-mail. It‚Äôs got coverflow and on and on. And this stuff would\\nnormally cost hundreds of dollars.\\nSo how much more than $499 should we price iPhone? Well, we thought long and hard\\nabout it, because iPhone just does so much stuff. So much better experience on call, on\\nmanaging your contacts and visual voice mail. Random access voice mail for the first time.\\nTexting and e-mail and real browser and Google Maps. Tremendous iPod and cover flow and\\nvideo. What should we price this thing at? Well, for a 4 gigabyte model, we‚Äôre going to price\\nit at that same $499. No premium whatsoever. $499.\\nAnd we‚Äôre going to have an 8 gigabyte model for just $599. So we‚Äôre going to price it\\nstarting at $499. Now, when‚Äôs it going to be available? We‚Äôre going to be shipping these in\\nJune. We‚Äôre announcing it today because with products like this we‚Äôve got to go ahead and\\nget FCC approval which takes a few months, and we thought it would be better if we\\nintroduced this rather than ask the FCC to introduce it for us. So here we are, and we‚Äôre\\ngoing to be shipping it in June in the U.S. We‚Äôre going to Europe hopefully by the fourth\\ncalendar quarter of this year. And in Asia in 2008.\\nSo in June, in just a few months, we‚Äôll be shipping in the U.S. And when we do, our partner\\nis going to be Cingular. We‚Äôve chosen Cingular. They are the best and most popular network\\nin the country. 58 million subscribers. They are number one. And they‚Äôre going to be our\\nexclusive partner in the U.S.\\nNow, it‚Äôs a unique partnership though. We‚Äôre not just going to be selling phones and\\nservices together. We‚Äôre going to be doing innovation together. We worked with Cingular on\\nvisual voice mail. Because it‚Äôs an innovation that requires both innovation on the phone and\\nin the network. You can‚Äôt do it in just one place. You have to do it in both places and\\ncollaborate. And so visual voice mail is the first fruit of this collaboration, and you will see\\nmore. And when we start shipping in June, we will be selling iPhone through our own stores,\\nand through Cingular stores. And it‚Äôs my pleasure to introduce the CEO of Cingular, Stan\\nSigman.\\nStan Sigman ‚Äì CEO, Cingular\\nThank you‚Ä¶.you know Steve and I first met about two years ago in New York City when he\\nshared with me this vision that he had for this product.

That was because of the confidence that I have in Steve and his\\nleadership team to deliver on the vision that they had and every time I see this ‚Äì its just\\nwow, it‚Äôs just wow! It‚Äôs really, really cool. You exceeded my expectations.\\nIt‚Äôs a real honor for Cingular to be partnering with Apple today and I‚Äôve brought with me\\nanother company to celebrate in this, and it‚Äôs a pretty big company.

We‚Äôre announcing a partnership that the\\nmobile phone experience ‚Äî takes in the mobile phone experience to the real new level, by\\nbringing together the best network with the best device.\\nNetworks are the foundation of what Cingular and AT&T do. Cingular offers the largest\\ndigital and voice data network in America today. The Cingular network has the fewest\\ndropped calls in this country. And AT&T is the largest provider of broadband Internet\\nservices in this community. When it comes to networks, AT&T wrote the book, their quality\\nis Legendary, put this network experience that Cingular and AT&T have and Apple products\\ntogether and what do you get ‚Äì first, you get the best voice and data services with the best\\nuser experience available anywhere. Second, you get real compelling products and services.\\nFor example, is the visual voicemail that Steve mentioned which lets you look at the voice\\nmessage you want to hear and when you want to hear it.\\nAs Steve mentioned, to create Visual Voicemail it took innovation on Cingular‚Äôs part, at the\\nnetwork level and by Apple with the device, and I promise you‚Äôll see more of that coming\\ndown the road.\\nThird, when you combine Cingular‚Äôs 2100 retail stores and number one wireless online store\\nwith Apple‚Äôs already legendary retail store and online stores, you‚Äôve got unmatched\\ndistribution. Yes, we‚Äôre truly pleased to partner with Apple to deliver one of the most\\neagerly awaited wireless products ever ‚Äì the iPhone that he showed you.\\nWith iPhone, you get a breakthrough wireless experience and we‚Äôll be working shoulder to\\nshoulder with Steve and his team to make sure that the integration of the iPhone and our\\nnetwork is seamless.

The new iPhone is only\\navailable with Cingular wireless services. This is not an MVNO. Ours is a unique\\nrelationship that lets Apple be Apple and Cingular be Cingular. Apple has built the device,\\ncombining the best phone, iPod and mobile internet experience ever. iPhone owners will be\\nCingular and AT&T customers. Our customers will get the best network and services in the\\nbusiness.\\nPeople will benefit from the best that companies they already know and trust at what they\\nhave to offer. Apple, Cingular and AT&T have come a long ways and now we‚Äôre picking up\\nthe pace. A little over six years ago, BellSouth and AT&T came together to form Cingular. 11\\ndays, Cingular joined the new AT&T. Today Cingular and AT&T are working together to\\nprovide our customers the most innovative, enjoyable and reliable service in the industry. I\\nhope you‚Äôre as excited as we are at what we have to see and enjoy here. This is going to be a\\nterrific ride. Thank you very much, Steve and congratulations.\\nSteve Jobs- Apple CEO\\nNow as Stan said, we started working together about two years ago and we come from\\npretty different worlds, the telecommunications industry, the computer industry and of\\ncourse music with the iPod, and yet we have worked wonderfully together. And we love\\nthese guys and we think it‚Äôs ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to bring some great stuff to market over the\\nyears together.\\nSo let‚Äôs take a look at this market, and how big it is. My clicker‚Äôs not working. Oh there it is.\\nSo how big is this market, well let‚Äôs take a look. Clicker is not working. They‚Äôre scrambling\\nbackstage right now.\\nYou know, when I was in high school, Steve Wozniak and I, mostly Steve, made this little\\ndevice called the TV jammer. And it was this little oscillator that put out frequencies that\\nwould screw up the TV. And Woz would have it in his pocket, and we‚Äôd go into like a dorm at\\nBerkeley where he was going to school and bunch of folks will be watching like Star Trek\\nand he‚Äôd screw up the TV, and somebody would go up to fix it, and just as they had their\\nfoot off the ground, he‚Äôd turn it back on. If they put their foot back on the ground he‚Äôd screw\\nup the TV again. And within five minutes he‚Äôd have somebody like this for the rest of the\\nStar Trek episode.\\nSo game consoles. 26 million game consoles were sold in 2006 worldwide, actually a little\\nsmaller than you‚Äôd think. It‚Äôs not such a big market. Digital cameras dwarfed it at 94 million.\\nMP3 players 135 million. And PCs, about 209. Mobile phones, just about a billion last year,\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

What this tells you is, that 1 percent market share equals 10\\nmillion units. This is a giant market. One percent market share, you‚Äôre going to sell 10\\nmillion phones. And this is exactly what we‚Äôre going to try to do in 2008, our first full year in\\nthe market, is grab 1 percent market share and go from there. So we‚Äôre going to enter a\\nvery competitive market, lot of players, we think we‚Äôre going to have the best product in the\\nworld, and we‚Äôre going to go for it and see if we can get 1 percent market share, 10 million\\nunits in 2008, and go from there.\\nSo, today, we‚Äôve added to the Mac and the iPod. We‚Äôve added Apple TV and now iPhone.\\nAnd you know, the Mac is really the only one that you think of as a computer. Right? And so\\nwe‚Äôve thought about this and we thought, you know, maybe our name should reflect this a\\nlittle bit more than it does.\\nSo we‚Äôre announcing today we‚Äôre dropping the computer from our name, and from this day\\nforward, we‚Äôre going to be known as Apple Inc., to reflect the product mix that we have\\ntoday.\\nI didn‚Äôt sleep a wink last night. I was so excited about today, because we‚Äôve been so lucky at\\nApple. We‚Äôve had some real revolutionary products. The Mac in 1984 is an experience that\\nthose of us that were there will never forget. And I don‚Äôt think the world will forget it either.\\nThe iPod in 2001 changed everything about music, and we‚Äôre going to do it again with the\\niPhone in 2007. We‚Äôre very excited about this.\\nThere‚Äôs an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. ‚ÄúI skate to where the puck is going to be,\\nnot where it has been‚Äù.
